Vertebrate eyes are complex sensory organs, defined as camera-type eyes. In the lab, we take full advantage of a newly established system, the golden apple snail Pomacea canaliculata , where - for the first time - full regeneration of adult camera-type eyes can be systematically explored at the molecular, cellular and genetic level. We use sequencing techniques, light microscopy and CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to expand our understanding of adult regeneration and stem cell biology. Our main goals are: identifying the cells that allow for regeneration, discover the gene regulatory network (GRN) that controls the regeneration of an adult eye and discriminate which components of this GRN are regeneration-specific and which one are shared with developmental programs. P. canaliculata is a great new platform to discover novel concepts in regeneration, plasticity and evolutionary conservation of the visual system.

Microtubules assemble from basic building blocks, known as alpha beta (\u03b1\u03b2) tubulin dimers, which polymerize head-to-tail to form protofilaments, using the energy of Guanosine 3,5 Triphosphate (GTP) binding and hydrolysis; These protofilaments associate laterally enclosing a tube-like structure-- a microtubule. Tubulin polymerization is driven by its\u00a0high concentration inside the cytoplasm and activates GTP hydrolysis upon its incorporation into microtubule lattices at their ends.\u00a0 However, during stochastic reversals, called catastrophes, tubulin protofilaments stop polymerizing and peel-out to rapidly dissemble microtubules. The Al-Bassam laboratory studies conserved multi-subunit molecular machines drive soluble \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin heterodimers biogenesis inside cells, and how \u03b1\u03b2-tubulins are polymerized or depolymerized at microtubule ends.\u00a0 These molecular machines are found in all eukaryotic organisms and act as \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin \u201cfactories\u201d, microtubule \u201cpolymerases\u201d or \u201cdepolymerases\u201d to accelerate specific aspects of microtubule dynamics inside cells.\u00a0 We also study the mechanism and regulation of kinesin motor proteins\u00a0involved in\u00a0organizing microtubules during bipolar spindle assembly during\u00a0mitosis.\u00a0\u00a0We are focused on deciphering mechanisms of molecular\u00a0machines and how they cooperate during cell division and development. We combine biochemistry with structural biology approaches such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography, and\u00a0high-resolution single molecule total internal reflection microscopy reconstitution studies to gain a full mechanistic view of structure in relation to function.\u00a0 Combining these\u00a0powerful approaches bridges a\u00a0large resolution range between the \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin\u00a0structure and its polymerization into\u00a0 microtubules, which span from micro-meter\u00a0to the sub-nano-meter scales. \u00a0\u00a0These approaches allow us to link \u00a0atomic organization and architectures of these molecular machines with \u03b1\u03b2-tubulin and\u00a0their conformational changes with their unique functional states at microtubule ends.

While traditional studies of signaling have focused on the identity of the proteins involved in such cascades and the nature of the interactions between them, we are studying how the activation dynamics of these pathways encode specific information for the cell. Our goal is to address the question of how specificity is achieved when the same small group of pathways (including ERK, Akt, AMPK, and mTOR) controls a diverse set of cellular behaviors (proliferation, growth, migration, apoptosis, autophagy, and differentiation). To decipher this signaling \u201ccode\u201d, we combine computational models with live cell data from genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors for phosphorylation or transcription events. By tracking signaling events in many individual cells and associating them with corresponding cellular phenotypes and the activation of specific genes, we aim to identify temporal signaling programs that drive cell behaviors. This knowledge can then be used to improve the results of therapeutic interventions in cancer and other diseases, by predicting the cellular responses to signaling inhibitors.

The three dimensional (3D) structure of the genome plays a key role in the dynamics of the living cell tightly regulating essential biological processes such as transcription, replication and repair. In humans, disruption of the 3D structure of the genome, in the form of large-scale rearrangements and copy number changes, is the signature of DNA-damaging agents and has been associated with a wide range of diseases, including cancer. In parasitic organisms, the 3D structure of the genome is a frequent drug target. Descriptions of the 3D structure genomes however have remained elusive even for the simplest organism. (1) We are developing new mathematical methods to characterize the packing of DNA in: dsDNA bacteriophages,\u00a0mitochondrial DNA in trypanosomes (kDNA)\u00a0and\u00a0yeast. (2) We are developing Topological Data Analysis methods for the molecular characterization of breast cancer. (3) Our response to COVID-19 : In\u00a0our most recent research we are investigating the mutation landscape of COVID-19. As of March 2020 COVID-19 has mutated and expanded across the human population; a total of 214 haplotypes (i.e. sequence variations) and 344 different strains have been identified. Most of these variations, gained through mutation, recombination, and natural selection, have been found in the Spike (S) protein. W e are developing a computational pipeline that estimates the mutation landscape of the COVID 19 \u2019s S protein, and simultaneously\u00a0 are measuring\u00a0binding of the S protein to the human receptor ACE2 using\u00a0cryo-electron microscopy.

Genome-wide mapping data from my laboratory established that R-loop structures are the most abundant non-B DNA structures in mammalian genomes and suggests that they represent a novel type of cis-acting DNA element. Our main research themes are: Developing and improving genomics technologies to map R-loop formation. Understanding the mechanisms by which R-loops are formed, sensed, and dynamically resolved. Analyzing the relationship between R-loop structures and genome stability. Elucidating how dysfunctions in R-loop metabolism are linked to human diseases. To address these topics, my group makes use of innovative (epi)genomics tools, mammalian cell culture and imaging assays, biochemical assays, proteomic methods, and computational approaches.

Viral structural proteins have the capacity to function both in assembly and in disassembly, which is made possible through a built-in flexibility triggered by cellular events. We observe conformational changes of viral particles at various states of their life cycle to analyze their assembly intermediates as well as the mature forms. Similarly, infectious virions can be treated with numerous conditions, e.g. receptor-mediated genome release or acid-activated membrane fusion, to observe the key steps of viral re-entry into host cells. Using electron microscopy, we apply a rapid-frozen and low-dose imaging procedure to best preserve the biological specimen in its native form. Computer image processing is developed to retrieve most of the useful signal from the low-contrast micrographs. Technical implementation of cryo-EM, cellular tomography, and computational modeling schemes also enables us to address interactions involved in complex biological molecules and/or nanoscale machines.

We study factors that function within the stem cells, as well as those that are required for the development of the somatic gonad, the germ cell niche. While zebrafish do not switch sex as adults, our lab has recently discovered that maintenance of the adult female sexual phenotype is an active process that requires continuous input from germ cells, as the reduction of germ cell numbers in an adult female results in female-to-male sex reversal. Our current research is focused on determining what signal is produced by the germ cells and how it influences the developmental state of the somatic gonad. The mechanisms mediating the development of the somatic gonad in vertebrates during the transition from the sexually bipotential state to the sex-specified state are well defined. In contrast, far less is known about the genes acting earlier during formation of the undifferentiated gonad primordium. We recently discovered that a mutation in a zebrafish Fgf ligand, fgf24 , results in the rapid loss of germ cells during early larval development, at a time prior to gonad differentiation. Our results suggest that the primary function of fgf24 is to promote the development of early somatic gonad cells and that the loss of germ cells in fgf24 mutants is secondary to this defect. We are currently investigating the role of fgf24 in regulating the development of the early somatic gonad.

I practice and promote evidence-based effective teaching strategies\u00a0and conduct research to understand and improve undergraduate biology education through a data-driven approach. High-impact teaching and learning practices in large-enrollment courses As undergraduate enrollment continues to grow nationwide, class sizes in both lower- and upper-division courses are increasing. How can high-enrollment biology classes be taught to maximize student engagement, interaction, inclusion, and learning? I collect classroom data to investigate the impact that different teaching practices\u00a0have on learning and students experience in high-enrollment courses. Promoting science skills and scientific literacy for the 21st century student Given the recent revolutionary changes in science, technology, and medicine, how can we reform undergraduate biology curricula to best prepare students for the scientific challenges they will encounter in their careers and lives?\u00a0I am interested in developing curriculum development that (1) integrates research skills and experiences, critical thinking, and problem-solving in biology\u00a0and (2) use examples that situate learning about biology in the context of societal and personal issues of interest to provide\u00a0access points for learning biology and developing strong scientific literacy. Developing and evaluating best practices for teaching and learning in Genetics Genetics is a fundamental component of undergraduate biology curricula. Most genetics courses cover content spanning classic Mendelian genetics and central dogma to cloning and genomics. I am interested in modernizing genetics courses to reflect current knowledge and practices that are essential for a 21st century learner as well as investigating\u00a0effective approaches for learning genetics and mitigating commonly formed misconceptions. Fostering evidence-based teaching practices among faculty and future faculty Due to recent national calls, there is an ongoing national effort towards transforming science education that necessitates\u00a0support and training in evidence-based effective teaching practices. In collaboration with the Center for Educational Effectiveness, I am active in providing resources and leading pedagogical training for faculty. I am also co-leading an effort to develop\u00a0a program for graduate students in undergraduate scientific teaching with the goal of providing pedagogical training and authentic teaching experience opportunities to graduate students in the biological sciences.

We are using single cell RNA sequencing to uncover the developmental trajectories and shed light on the regulatory control of development. Hydra has remarkable regenerative ability, including the ability to regenerate from a small piece of tissue or even reassemble from dissociated single cells. We are interested in understanding how injury signals trigger developmental pathways during regeneration. We are interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow Hydra stem cells to continually replace cells in an essentially \u201cimmortal\u201d animal. We study the function of the PIWI-piRNA pathway in Hydra stem cells, which we hypothesize is required to maintain genomic integrity.

Our recent work suggests that a series of feedback loops help to ensure the damage-free resolution of sister chromatids. In particular, we are interested in the intersection between checkpoints and chromosome passenger proteins and how they combine to regulate a divers array of cellular activities in response to DNA replication stress, including\u00a0spindle forces as well as membrane dynamics involved in nucleophagy. Chromosome instability in cancer: These set of questions\u00a0originated with our efforts to understand how cancer cells gain a chromosome instability (CIN) phenotype (one path to aneuploidy). We focused our early work on colorectal cancer as cells isolated from these cancers exhibit a high rate of mitotic errors. Our work demonstrated that one major contributor to chromosome instability comes from the initiating mutation in the tumor suppressor, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). \u00a0Though we remain interested in mechanisms that contribute to chromosome instability in cancers, our initial studies led us to focus on a paradox described by a number of labs studying cells with extra chromosomes, or aneuploidy. Namely, aneuploidy has been shown to lead to cell stress (e.g., proteotoxic and replication stress)\u00a0that are generally not favorable for cell\u00a0divisions, yet cancer cells divide and expand in the presence of these stresses.\u00a0The answer to this paradox may lie in the ability of pre-cancer cells to be \"reprogrammed\" so that they adapt to tolerate the aneuploid state (as well as other cancer-associated changes). We term this reprogramming as cancer cell \"adaption\" and we propose that it involves a specific set of molecular changes that increase the likelihood that normal cells with sustain cancer-associated changes (i.e., a cancer \"permissive\" state).

McKenney Position Title Associate Professor Molecular and Cellular Biology rjmckenney@ucdavis.edu 3225 Green Hall Bio Research Interests I have a long-standing research interest in the cytoskeleton, and in particular the motor proteins that utilize the cytoskeleton as tracks for intracellular transport. I was fortunate to have an opportunity at basic research beginning early in my undergraduate career, where I worked on signaling pathways related to cancer. This work afforded me valuable, early experience in the lab, and confirmed to me that I wanted to pursue research as a career. I pursued graduate research focused on the mechanochemical regulation of the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein. At Columbia University, I joined the lab of Dr. Richard Vallee, who discovered the motor protein cytoplasmic dynein. My work was the first to describe how two regulatory proteins, LIS1 and NudE, are able to modulate dynein\u2019s motor output, transforming it from a weak to a persistent motor. This work combined biochemistry and biophysical approaches to provide insights into long-standing questions in the dynein and brain development fields, as LIS1 is the causative gene of the neurodevelopmental disease lissencephaly. I then moved to the lab of Dr. Ron Vale at UCSF to continue my studies on dynein using advanced single molecule microscopy. In Ron's lab I have made several contributions to the dynein field, including how dynein organizes microtubule networks, how it is activated and linked to cargo through the dynactin complex and adapter proteins, and how its motor activity is directly influenced by post-translational modification of the microtubule track itself. My lab is interested in the fascinating world of molecular movement. We study how cells internally organize using molecular motor proteins. In particular, we focus on the microtubule cytoskeleton and the motor proteins that use this filament system for transport (kinesins and dyneins). We are interested in allosteric regulation of motor protein movement, how motor activity is balanced and coordinated, and\u00a0how dysfunction in motor activity leads to human diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The lab combines advanced molecular biology, biochemistry and single-molecule TIRF microscopy to address these problems.

In females of both plants and animals, only one of four sets of chromosomes segregated during meiosis is inherited by a gamete. In animals, this asymmetric inheritance is mediated by asymmetric meiotic spindle positioning and highly asymmetric cell divisions that yield a large haploid egg. We are interested in the mechanisms that mediate these asymmetric divisions and utilize C. elegans because both meiotic divisions can be filmed in utero using fluorescent protein fusions and time-lapse imaging. We use a combination of classical genetics, RNAi and biochemistry to elucidate the roles of proteins that regulate microtubule-based motility, microtubule organization and microtubule dynamics in meiotic cell division.

I have used my classroom as a laboratory to test ideas and learn more about student perspectives and experiences. Promoting writing in a large STEM class Most people would agree that being able to communicate in writing is an essential part of any career. However, students rarely have the opportunity to write in upper division lecture based courses in biology. Writing apprehension on behalf of students and logistical difficulties on behalf of the instructor are two large barriers to creating fulfilling and productive writing assignments in a large STEM course. I have always used writing assignments to explore student interests and create context in small lecture based courses and I wanted to see how I could scale up these successful assignments to work in a large upper division biochemistry course. I have worked for many quarters to design and optimize writing assignments in BIS102, a large upper division biochemistry course (200-400 students), using student feedback and other metrics to assess efficacy. In this project, I have explored peer feedback, peer grading, expert-led peer feedback, and many aspects of assignment design and seen positive changes in student perspectives on writing as well exam grades. Promoting conceptual thinking and raising awareness of algorithmic thinking in problem solving After teaching biochemistry for several quarters, I noticed that some students approached problem solving in memorizable steps, but did not have conceptual understanding of what those steps accomplished. This approach, often described as algorithmic thinking, is necessary in some contexts but can impede understanding if conceptual understanding is not also sought. I am interested in 1) devising ways to detect when students use algorithmic rather than conceptual approaches to problem solving in biochemistry and 2) create assignments that promote conceptual understanding and raise awareness of when a student is using algorithmic thinking in biochemistry. Part of this project has involved qualitatively coding student answers on written response exams to understand the depth of understanding and how the rubric can be better aligned to the learning objectives.

The goal of my lab is to understand the complex interplay between microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) that regulate a number of\u00a0cytoskeleton-based processes during neuronal development and maintenance.\u00a0Microtubules are dynamic polymers that not only provide structural support, but also serve as intracellular tracks for dynein and kinesin motors that must efficiently transport cargoes for the establishment and maintenance of cellular organization and function. However, these motors encounter numerous non-enzymatic MAPs\u00a0on the lattice that can dictate when and where motor progression can occur within a cell. We are only beginning to understand how MAPs in their unaltered states control microtubule dynamics and microtubule-based transport, but MAPs themselves are heavily modified by a handful of kinases whose regulatory effects remain unclear. Our lab seeks to dissect the multiple layers of regulation of microtubule-based processes by studying the biochemical and genetic relationships between kinases,\u00a0MAPs, and motors\u00a0both in vivo and in vitro.

Our goals are two-fold: to understand the mechanism of action through which genetic variation modulates our risk of different diseases and traits, as well as to identify actionable therapeutic targets. We have published a number of papers on characterizing the genetics of obesity and Alzheimer's disease, and have more recently focused on psychiatric and other mental disorders. We are developing neural network-based models of population-level behavior of single cells. Sequencing technologies are routinely used to generate high resolution, high dimensional snapshots of individual cells. However, they historically are poor at capturing cell population-level behavior as well as time-varying behavior, because cells are sacrificed before sequencing. On the other hand, imaging-based technologies can be used to observe e.g. transcriptional behavior over time of a limited number of genes. Here we combine imaging-based and sequencing-based methodologies to model how cells interact and influence each other's transcriptome. Shown in the figure above is an illustration of one such project, where we used single cell genomics data on non-malignant cells cultured either alone (S1) or co-cultured with malignant cells (S1 co-cultured with T4-2), to predict that S1 gene regulation of the ERK pathway is disrupted by proximity to T4-2 cells. This is evident both at the gene regulatory network level, as well as through reporter assays of individual genes. Our understanding of the dynamics of molecular events in the cell has been rapidly increasing, thanks to the many ways in which DNA sequencing has been repurposed to study different aspects of gene regulation. The relationship of gene regulation to cellular-level phenotypes and events, however, is poorly understood, in large part because they are hard to jointly measure experimentally.

In animal cells, the division furrow typically bisects the mitotic spindle. Thus, the cell division plane is determined by the position of the mitotic spindle. Proper division orientation is essential for a number of developmental and homeostatic processes. These include intrinsically specified asymmetric divisions in which a cell divides to produce daughters with different fates at birth. During such divisions the parent cell is polarized for particular cortical or cytoplasmic components; the spindle must align with this axis for division to result in the differential segregation of such components to the daughter cells, which gives them different developmental fates. During extrinsically asymmetric divisions, although the parent cell is not polarized the spindle/division orientation places daughters in different positions and thus different environments, which results in different fates. Both types of asymmetric division are important for generating cell diversity during development, as well as for the ability of adult stem cells to produce a self-renewing stem cell and a daughter that differentiates; asymmetric division also affects the proliferative capacity of some cell types and defects in spindle positioning and polarity have been implicated in cancer. We utilize the model system C. elegans for the majority of our studies, and employ a variety of genetic, molecular and cell biological techniques.

We are recently examining a nuclear migration event where the nucleus must deform to squeeze through a narrow opening. Once the nucleus has migrated to the correct location, there are mechanisms to anchor the nucleus there. Defects in nuclear positioning can lead to developmental defects and diseases such as Lisencephaly and Muscular Dystrophy. However, very little is known about the mechanisms of nuclear positioning. We are using the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study how nuclei and other organelles are positioned within a cell. We use imaging, genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches to study this basic problem in cell biology.

He came to UC Davis following 25 years of teaching, research and leadership at the University of Colorado, Boulder. He is a distinguished biologist, an experienced administrator and a strong advocate of biology education at every level. Dean Winey graduated from Syracuse University with a B.S. in Biology with honors and earned a Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Following graduate school, he served as an NIH Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Genetics at the University of Washington. In 1991, he joined the faculty at the University of Colorado, Boulder where he eventually attained tenure. From 2012 to 2016, Winey served as the chair of the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. Winey's research explores the genetics and molecular biology of microtubule organizing centers, which include the cellular structures called centrosomes that are critical for organizing the spindles needed to ensure accurate movement of chromosomes during cell division. Centrosome defects can result in genomic instability that may contribute to the development of cancer as well as to chromosome mis-segregation that can lead to miscarriages. Winey\u2019s academic honors include the distinction of Guggenheim Fellow and Pew Scholar, and he was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2014. In 2019, Mark was named a Fellow of the American Society for Cell Biology.
