She is a past president of the American Society of Primatologists and the editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Primatology . Research Focus Professor Bales studies the physiology, neurobiology and development of social bonding, particularly in monogamous species. She works with prairie voles ( Microtus ochrogaster ), titi monkeys ( Plecturocebus cupreus ), and seahorses ( Hippocampus erectus) , all species in which males and females form pair-bonds, and males provide pre- or post-natal care for infants. In particular, she is interested in the role of neuropeptides such as oxytocin and vasopressin in these behaviors, as well as the effects of early experiences on the development of these behaviors. Her current research (funded by NIMH) focuses on the role of the kappa opioid and oxytocin system in social buffering and separation.

She received her PhD in Social and Personality Psychology from Washington University in St. Louis in 2020 and her BA (with honors) from Brown University in 2016. Dr. Beck is not currently recruiting undergraduate students or graduate students to join the lab at this time. Research Focus Dr. Beck's research focuses around the question of what personality is. Definitions have big consequences for how we measure personality, what those measures predict both short- and long-term, how personality is thought to change, and more. One way of doing this is to focus on different levels of aggregation. Thus, she studies how to understand the personality of an individual relative to only themself, relative to some others, and relative to all others. To do so, she uses a mix of methods, including experience sampling methods, passive sensing, survey data, panel data, cognitive tests, and more measured across time intervals from moments to years along with an array of statistical approaches, including time series analysis, multilevel / hierarchical modeling, machine learning, network psychometrics, structural equation modeling, and more. For example, Dr. Beck has been working to build personalized machine learning prediction of behaviors, experiences, and more, finding that we can predict behaviors and experiences better when we don't assume that people have the same antecedents of the behaviors and experiences.  Instead, people have unique antecedents, which could have consequences for how to change or intervene upon behaviors and experiences. In other work, Dr. Beck uses longitudinal panel data across multiple continents to answer questions about what personality traits predict over time. For example, she recently examined personality trait and well-being predictors of later dementia diagnoses and neuropathology measures after death, finding that personality traits are strong predictors of dementia diagnosis but have a much more complex relationship with neuropathology measures.

Bowman is an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in developmental psychology. With experience as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland Child Development Lab and as a research fellow in the Labs of Cognitive Neuroscience at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children\u201aA\u0308o\u0302s Hospital, her work brings together unique perspectives on neuroscience, cognition, and social understanding in the developmental context. She uses a combination of neuroscientific and behavioral methods to illuminate developing cognition and pathways to adaptive and maladaptive social behavior across infancy and childhood. Dr. Bowman is a member of professional organizations including the Society for Research in Child Development, the Cognitive Development Society, the Cognitive Neuroscience Society, and the International Congress on Infant Studies. She has received awards from the Canadian Psychological Association, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the University of Michigan, and Queen\u201aA\u0308o\u0302s University. Dr. Bowman is also the Principle Investigator of the Brain and Social Cognition (BASC) Lab in the Center for Mind and Brain at UC Davis. She welcomes participation from undergraduate and graduate students who have interests that overlap with her research focus. Research Focus Humans navigate a complex social world. We communicate, cooperate, empathize; we process the changing expressions, actions, and interactions around us; we reason about the covert contents of the mind to predict and explain overt behavior. In short, we develop social cognition\u201aA\u0308i\u0302a crucial understanding of the self and others that allows and constrains these fundamental skills. How does social cognition develop? And what are the characteristics of the developing \u201aA\u0308o\u0300social brain\u201aA\u0308o\u0302? Research in the BASC Lab represents pioneering forays into these intriguing but as yet unanswered questions. We work with EEG, ERP, and occasionally fNIRS data to develop new measures examining neural correlates of social cognition over infancy and childhood. We use these neuroscientific methods in combination with behavioral assessments and observational data to uncover the developmental process and its neural basis over periods of biological, experiential, and conceptual change.

Our lab is working to uncover how the 'social brain' develops! As humans, we navigate a complex social world in which we communicate, cooperate, and empathize; we reason about the covert contents of the mind to predict and explain overt behavior. From a young age, infants and children are forming the building blocks of social understanding and competent social behavior. We're interested in how the brain supports this development, and how brain developments interact with and are influenced by aspects of the child's environment. We conduct behavioral research in conjunction with the use of EEG, ERP, and fNIRS to examine the neural correlates of social cognition.

My work combines methods from artificial intelligence (e.g., reinforcement learning, neural networks) with those from cognitive psychology (e.g., study of unobserved \"cognitive\" processes, targeted task design) and neuroscience (e.g., moment-to-moment \"neural\" recordings). I am particularly interested in how we - and how artificial systems - learn and make decisions, and how we represent memories and knowledge, structuring our thought and reasoning processes. I obtained my PhD in cognitive psychology from UC Berkeley, working with Anne Collins and Silvia Bunge. The work in my lab will focus on Reinforcement Learning in humans and artificial agents, on neural network modeling, and on collecting and analyzing increasingly large and naturalistic data. Questions will involve the (hierarchical) structure of mental representations and the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie learning and memory. I will be accepting PhD students.

Fox is a member of a number of organizations including the Society for Neuroscience and the Society of Biological Psychiatry. Research Focus In the Fox lab, we want to understand the neurobiology of \u201aA\u0308u\u0301affective style\u201aA\u0308u\u0300. We want to understand why some people are afraid to leave the house, while others enjoy the feeling of danger. We want to understand why some people callously abuse, while others become overwhelmed with empathy. We hope that understanding the biology of affective style will lead us to a better understand humanity and help people make choices about who they want to be. Much of our research aims to understand the biology that underlies dispositional anxiety. This kind of understanding could allow for specific interventions to ameliorate anxiety disorders and reduce the suffering of anxious individuals. To do this, we use varied tools to study humans and nonhuman primates, including: high-throughput computing, neuroimaging, RNA-sequencing, cellphone-based experience sampling, and designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs.

Tags Perception, Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience Area Head Administrative Staff Research Area(s) Perception, Cognition & Cognitive Neuroscience Research Lab Integrated Attention Lab (Geng) Our sensory worlds are filled with information, but we are only aware of a small proportion of it at any particular moment in time. Attention is the mechanism that prioritizes processing according to our goals. But what determines what our goals are and how well we can maintain them over time and in the face of distractions? Research in the lab focuses on how behavioral goals and prior experiences interact with sensory events to determine perception and cognition. To study these topics we use a combination of eye-tracking, psychophysics, fMRI and EEG/ERPs, and work with others to use TMS, pharmacology and patient studies.

Goodman is Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Director of the Center for Public Policy Research at the University of California, Davis. She is widely credited with starting the modern scientific study of children's eyewitness memory and child victims as witnesses in legal contexts. Professor Goodman publishes widely, has received numerous grants, and has been honored with many national and international awards. She has consulted with numerous governments and agencies throughout the world on policies and research concerning child victims in the legal system. She serves as a consultant for the Special Assault Forensic Evaluation Center (formerly Multidisciplinary Interview Center) of the Sacramento County Child Protective Services. She is a fellow of many professional organizations, including the Association for Psychological Science and the American Psychological Association (Divisions: Experimental Psychology, 3; Developmental Psychology, 7; Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, 9; Society for Child and Family Policy and Practice, 37; American Psychology-Law Society, 41; Psychology of Women, 35; and Traumatic Stress, 56). Professor Goodman is also a member of the Psychonomics Society, Society for Research in Child Development, American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (Founding Member), International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, and International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. She has served as president of three divisions (Division 37, Society for Child and Family Policy and Practice; Division 41, American Psychology-Law Society; and Division 7, Developmental Psychology) and one Section (Child Maltreatment) of the American Psychological Association. Research Focus Professor Goodman's research falls into two major areas: memory development and children's abilities and experiences as victims/witnesses. In the memory development area, her work explores theoretical issues concerning the relation between trauma and memory, attachment and memory, and semantic and epidosic memory, as well as the relation between emotion and memory. In the victim/witness area, her research focuses on children's ability to provide testimony about events they have experienced or witnessed, especially events related to child abuse, and on the psychological effects on children and adults of legal and social service involvement. She is also currently studying emotional adjustment/psychopathology (e.g., PTSD) after traumatic events, children\u201aA\u0308o\u0302s and adults\u201aA\u0308o\u0302 disclosures of child maltreatment, adults\u201aA\u0308o\u0302 judgments of the accuracy of eyewitness memory, juror decision making, forensic interview techniques, and procedural justice.

Research Focus Infants are immersed in a world of immense complexity, yet they display knowledge of the people, objects, actions, and sounds in their environments very early in life. Professor Graf Estes\u201aA\u0308o\u0302 research explores the mechanisms that support this early learning. In particular, the ability to detect statistical regularities may play a fundamental role in how infants learn about a highly complex, highly salient aspect of the auditory world: language. Infants become especially attuned to regularities in the sound patterns of the ambient language, including its phoneme distinctions, sound combinations within words, and its cues to word boundaries in fluent speech. Thus, when infants begin to understand and produce words, they do not start as blank slates.

We are especially interested in how supportive social relationships reduce the effects of stress on our health, and may promote healthier biological profiles across development. Another goal of our lab is to better understand self-regulation skills, how stress affects these skills and other behaviors that require self-regulation. The long-term vision for this research is to suggest strategies and inform interventions that would reduce the impact of stress on developmental outcomes, especially for disadvantaged youth that too often confront several types of stressors in their lives.

Research Focus My empirical research integrates foundations of cognitive, social, and emotional knowledge by investigating children\u201aA\u0308o\u0302s and adults\u201aA\u0308o\u0302 understanding about connections between different kinds of mental states (e.g., how thoughts influence emotions; how emotions shape decisions), as well as their reasoning about how people\u201aA\u0308o\u0302s negative and positive life experiences bias how they later interpret and emotionally react to new situations, make decisions, and anticipate the future. Additional research investigates how children and adults attend to and process emotional stimuli, development and individual differences in cognitive processes, biases and heuristics in how children and adults perceive social groups, prosocial decision making and intergroup biases, reasoning about willpower and transgression, and recognition of diversity versus common ground in how different people interpret and emotionally respond to situations.

One of the most basic challenges that people face in everyday life is how to cross gaps\u2014gaps that separate self from other, now from future, here from there, and us from them. Even the simplest activities, like having a conversation or planning what to do next week, would be impossible if it were not for the human capacity to get unstuck from current experience and relate to other people, future time points and distant contexts. The research in our lab centers around the social psychological tools that humans have developed to help them reach across these distances.

Mangun is the founding and currently Co-Director of the UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain, and Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Neurology at the University of California, Davis. In 1998 he was the founding director of the Duke University Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, and then in 2002 founded the UC Davis Center for Mind and Brain. From 2008 to 2015 he served as UC Davis Dean of Social Sciences. He leads the Laboratory for the Neural Mechanisms of Attention, which is supported by grants from NSF, NIH, and corporate and foundation partners. Professor Mangun has consulted on numerous university, U.S. government and international scientific panels and advisory boards, including for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council, the Department of Defense, the European Research Council (European Union), the Academy of Finland, the Ministry of Higher Education and Research of the Basque Government (Spain), and the Max Planck Society (Germany). He is coauthor of the leading textbook, Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind (W.W. Norton, 2019); now in its fifth edition, the book has been translated into French, Italian, Portuguese and Chinese. Professor Mangun was a Senior Editor of the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, the Editor of Cognitive Brain Research, a Senior Editor for Brain Research; he is currently the founding Editor-in-Chief for Frontiers in Cognition , and is a member of the Governing Board of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society. Research Focus Professor Mangun's work on the neuroscience of attention investigates how we perceive, attend, ignore and become aware of events in our environment. Recordings of brain electrical activity (EEG) in healthy persons and special patient groups provide high temporal resolution measures of stimulus processing in the human brain. The goal of this research is to identify the mechanisms of attentional selection by permitting sensory analysis of attended and ignored stimuli to be studied under a wide variety of task circumstances. To identify the brain systems and networks involved in attention (i.e., control and selection), tools such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are used in conjunction with EEG. fMRI permits the living human brain to be revealed as it functions to enable our sensations, thoughts and actions, and EEG enables the measurement of brain dynamics. The information obtained from these combined behavioral, neuropsychological, and neurophysiological studies yields insight into the computational and functional-neuroanatomical structure of human perception and cognition, and is essential for addressing the deficits in attention and awareness that accompany neurological and psychiatric disease.

Over the next several years, Professor Mosley\u201aA\u0308o\u0302s aim is to conduct basic and applied research that promotes social equality, improves intergroup relations, and cultural understanding. She plans to expand her work on cultural appropriation, social identity, and intersectionality, to further investigate how these psychological processes can facilitate ways to reduce intergroup biases and oppression. Research Focus Professor Mosley's work investigates the ways that social categorization and social identity structure judgments of, and responses to, different forms of intergroup inequalities. Her current program of research is driven by the following questions: (a) How do group-based biases and social power influence how group members respond to acts of cultural appropriation, (b) How do intersectional stereotypes affect the categorizations and experiences of diverse individuals, and (c) What are the experiences, adaptations, and resiliencies of marginalized group members who are subjected to discrimination? Combining theoretical perspectives of social cognition, intergroup relations, and racial inequality, Professor Mosley's work uses a variety of research methods such as experimental design, mediation analyses, and meta-analyses to evaluate concerns associated with different forms of inequality - both from the target and the perceiver's perspective.

She is also the director of the Cognition in Context Lab . Her research uses behavioral, electrophysiological, computational, and cross-cultural approaches to study the mechanisms supporting executive functions and variations in thinking observed across development. Professor Munakata co-edited two books on brain and cognitive development, and co-authored two editions of a textbook on computational cognitive neuroscience. She gave a TEDx talk on The science behind how parents affect child development . She previously served as Associate Editor for Psychological Review . Her research is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health. Research Focus Professor Munakata investigates the remarkable variations in thinking that people show across contexts. Thinking can change based on our goals, motivations, and propensities, as they develop across infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, and in relation to our physical, social, and cultural environments. How can we understand these variations in thinking? How can we build on this understanding to support adaptive thinking and development? To address these questions, Professor Munakata investigates the cognitive, neural, and computational processes that support thinking and variations in thinking across diverse contexts. Many projects in her lab focus on executive functions, given the role that executive functions play in shaping thoughts and behaviors, the dramatic changes observed across development, and the links between executive functioning and important life outcomes.

Park Breadcrumb Home People Jonathan J. Park Position Title Assistant Professor imJPark@UCDavis.edu Bio About Dr. Jonathan Park is an assistant professor of quantitative psychology in the Department of Psychology at UC Davis. I obtained my PhD in Human Development and Family Studies with a focus on Quantitative Methods from the Pennsylvania State University. Formally, my research focuses on how to best handle and model heterogeneity in dynamic networks. People exhibit prototypical behavioral patterns that fluctuate over time, and individual dynamic networks tend to be largely idiosyncratic\u2014very few people change and fluctuate in the same way. This makes identifying key dynamic patterns across individuals quite challenging. For example, depression may manifest differently across individuals and their patterns of mood and behavior can vary significantly from person to person. By examining these dynamic patterns, we may uncover similarities in how depression unfolds across groups of people. However, different statistical models (e.g., multilevel, person-specific modeling) impose varying constraints on how individuals can differ relative to one another (e.g., continuous versus discrete differences) and whether we conclude whether individuals are similar at all. My lab focuses on the impact of modeling decisions on the analysis of multi-subject multiple time-series and how these decisions can lead to dramatically different results such as the choice of modeling in discrete- or continuous-time. We also develop methods to reduce classification errors and ambiguity in group membership through the development and testing of community detection algorithms using principles of fuzzy statistics and distribution-based clustering methods.

He is also director of the Dynamic Memory Lab at UC Davis and is an affiliated faculty with the Center for Mind and Brain. His research involves the use of functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology and behavioral methods to study the neural basis of human memory and executive control. He previously served as editor for the Cognitive Neuroscience Section of the journal NeuroImage , and currently serves as an editor for the Journal of Neuroscience , which is the most influential academically edited journal in the field of neuroscience. Professor Ranganath has consulted for government and private funding agencies from several countries and has served on review panels for the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation. Research Focus Professor Ranganath's research concerns the neurocognitive structure of human memory and executive control. One set of studies currently underway concerns the relationship between short-term, or working memory, and long-term memory. Results from event-related fMRI studies conducted by Professor Ranganath suggest that overlapping regions of the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobes are active during both working memory and long-term memory tasks. This research suggests that a common neural system supports both of these types of memory. Currently, Professor Ranganath is investigating how different regions within the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobes contribute to working and long-term memory through additional fMRI studies of healthy young adults and behavioral testing of patients with focal brain damage. A second, related area of interest is the role of prefrontal cortex in the control and evaluation of information in memory. Finally, in collaboration with Andy Yonelinas, Professor Ranganath is investigating the roles of different medial temporal lobe regions in recognition memory processes. To address this issue, he is conducting parallel studies using event-related fMRI and event-related brain potentials in healthy young and older adults and amnesic patients with medial temporal lobe damage. In collaboration with another research group, he is also conducting studies to examine field potentials recorded directly from the human hippocampal formation in patients performing recognition memory tasks.

His research lies at the intersection of advanced quantitative methodology, psychometrics, and the empirical study of lifespan development and aging. Research Focus Philippe Rast works in the development, evaluation, and application of quantitative methods, mainly longitudinal models for examining change over time and how individuals differ in this change. He integrates mostly Bayesian methods for simultaneously examining intra-individual variability (change at the individual level) and inter-individual differences in such changes in the context of the examination of cognitive processes and changes in emotion and stress. Philippe Rast's research interests are in individual differences in learning and cognitive development; improvement of prediction of cognitive decline using individual differences in learning functions; and the investigation of potential for improving, maintaining, and preventing decline of functioning across the adult lifespan. He has made contributions to the analysis and design of longitudinal studies, with particular emphasis on methods to disentangle within- and between-person change and variation in longitudinal designs. His research also includes the development of single case models that allow one to estimate and predict behavior and behavioral consistency for single individuals. He is the author and co-author of multiple R-packages that are geared toward the modeling of within-person variability in high-frequency time series data. Lab Rast Lab Publications Martin, S.

Research Focus Professor Schank is interested in how complex group and social behaviors emerge from relatively simple rules of individual behavior. His work examines how these rules change in organisms as a consequence of development and social experience. To achieve these ends, he uses individual-based modeling as a tool for analyzing social behavior, discovering individual rules, and revealing how these rules change as a function of development and social experience. Professor Schank is also interested in the implications of this view for the evolution of social behavior and has general interests in historical and conceptual issues in the life sciences.

Findings are used to shape practice and policy in family building through gamete donation. Professor Scheib also directs the research program at The Sperm Bank of California in Berkeley. Research Focus Professor Scheib's research focuses on understanding the experiences of families created through donor conception, and the donors who assist them. In collaboration with The Sperm Bank of California (TSBC) in Berkeley, she examines the experiences of (i) intended parents (\"recipients\") using a donor program to have children, (ii) donor-conceived people across different family types, (iii) donors after they leave the program, and (iv) the outcome of releasing donor identities to donor-conceived adults. Findings from this work help guide policy development in open-identity gamete donation, and the support needed for all participants. TSBC is the oldest organization in the world to offer open-identity donation, meaning that people conceived with the help of this program are among the first adults to access their donor's identity in planned releases.

Research Focus The overall goal of Professor Stolzenberg\u201aA\u0308o\u0302s research is to advance our understanding of the neurobiology of parental behavior. The question of how experiences that occur throughout the lifetime produce enduring effects on brain and behavior is a fundamental part of this research program. She focuses on motherhood as a significant experience gained in adulthood, which robustly affects brain and behavior. Her research suggests that the experience of becoming a mother results in a sustained sensitivity toward infants that is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms in the brain. Her laboratory uses behavioral, neuropharmacological and molecular techniques to explore the mechanisms by which infant interactions induce and sustain high levels of parental responding.

Before coming to UC Davis, he was a faculty member in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Iowa and a postdoctoral researcher at Social Cognition Center Cologne (Germany). Much of his research focuses on how people make sense of what others are thinking and feeling, and the implications of such mental state reasoning for negotiating socially diverse environments. He currently serves as an associate editor at the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology . Research Focus Professor Todd's research spans several topics: (1) perspective taking, empathy, and mental state reasoning; (2) cognitive processes underlying social categorization, evaluation, inference, and judgment; and (3) stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination based on race and other social categories (e.g., age, gender). In a primary line of research, he explores how perceiver-based factors (e.g., incidental emotions), target-based factors (e.g., group membership), and contextual factors (e.g., time pressure) influence the ability to intuit what other people see, know, want, and believe. He also examines how actively considering other people's mental states (e.g., their thoughts, feelings, and other subjective experiences) affects the subtle biases that pervade intergroup encounters and social inference more generally. In other work, he studies how spontaneously activated mental processes interact with more deliberately enacted processes to guide people's impressions of others. He's particularly interested in how a greater understanding of these processes can inform social issues (e.g., intergroup relations, diversity management). Publications Surtees, A. D.

She received her PhD in Social and Personality Psychology in 2022 and her B.S. in Psychology in 2017 from the University of California, Riverside. Dr. Westberg will be recruiting undergraduate students to join her lab to help with qualitative data analysis and other research projects in Fall 2024. She is also currently accepting applications for new graduate students for the 2024-2025 application cycle. Research Focus I am interested in how individuals navigate social structures and the implications of such structures for personality and identity. In my research, I examine variations in life narratives around race, ethnicity, gender, and social class, in relation to psychosocial adjustment and identity. Life narratives are the internal constructions of who the person is, was, and will become that provide one with a sense of meaning, purpose, and continuity. Through my work in this area, I aim to reveal how systems of power and oppression guide and constrain personality. I use both qualitative and quantitative approaches to advance understanding of the person in relation to social structures. I recently examined variations in life narratives among racially and ethnically diverse young adults, finding that men told more positive stories around structural domains relative to women and participants who mentioned more structural domains across their narratives made more meaning of their experiences (see https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tvcfz ).

He is also associate director of the Center for Mind and Brain, and director of the Human Memory Lab, which aims to understand how memory works \u201aA\u0308\u00b6 and why it often fails. In addition, he serves as an associate member of several professional organizations, including the Psychonomic Society, the Society for Neuroscience, the Cognitive Neuroscience Society, the American Psychological Association, the Memory Disorders Research Society and the Society of Experimental Psychologists. Professor Yonelinas also serves as a grant reviewer for the National Institute of Health, the National Science Foundation, the California Department of Health Services, the Alzheimer\u201aA\u0308o\u0302s Disease Program, the Medical Research Council, and the Economic & Social Research Council. He is an editorial board member for numerous publications, including Proceedings of the National Academy of Science ; Psychonomic Bulletin and Review ; Journal of Experimental Psychology ; Learning, Memory & Cognition ; Journal of Experimental Psychology: General ; Journal of Memory and Language ; and Memory and Cognition . Research Focus Professor Yonelinas examines the processes underlying human memory. In order to characterize the functional nature of different memory processes he uses implicit and explicit tests as well as several 'second generation' procedures such as the process dissociation procedure, the independence remember/know procedure, and ROC modeling procedure. In order to determine the neural substrates of memory encoding and retrieval processes he i) examines memory-impaired patients such as amnesics and Alzheimer's patients, and ii) examines the physiological correlates of memory processes using neuroimaging techniques, such as event-related potentials and function magnetic resonance imaging. The goal of this work is to develop and test models of memory that address recent behavioral, neuropsychological and brain imaging data. Other research interests include studying action slips (i.e., habitual actions that interrupt intended actions) and examining the relationship between performance and conscious awareness.

We also investigate the brain networks involved in memory using neuroimaging methods like fMRI, and by examining people with memory problems related to medical conditions such as stroke and cardiac arrest.
