And (2) how does geomorphic evolution of landscapes interact with biological evolution of organisms at the time scale relevant to both processes? Xiaoli is particularly interested in developing general theoretical frameworks to understand how an ecosystem works.

Matt's work spans several topical areas, including fisheries, marine protected areas, climate change, coastal resilience, and adaptive management of marine resources. He employs a diverse set of methodological tools in his research, ranging from reduced-form and structural econometrics, to dynamic numerical analysis and simulation, integrated bioeconomic modeling, and field experiments. Matt is also heavily involved in the policymaking process for U.S. federal fisheries: he is currently a member of the Science and Statistical Committee (SSC) for the Pacific Fisheries Management Council and a former member of the SSC for the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council.
