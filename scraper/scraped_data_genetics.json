For faithful replication, the replication phases of initiation, elongation and termination must be coordinated to copy the nuclear DNA once and only once per cell cycle. Faithful replication must also retain higher order epigenetic components of chromatin that confer transcriptional regulation, three-dimensional organization, and cell identity. DNA damage can arise as a consequence of replicative stress, a phenomenon that encompasses a wide array of conditions leading to replication fork stalling or collapse. Defects in replication can lead to DNA damage and inappropriate repair can result in heritable mutations\u2014including point mutations, deletion or duplication events, or chromosomal translocations\u2014all of which are hallmarks of cancer. DNA replication begins with the coordinated association of over 100 proteins onto DNA at starting points -- called origins -- at tens of thousands of distinct genomic sites in mammals. Replication fork collapse results in a double-strand break (DSB) in the DNA, which requires proteins involved in homologous recombination (HR) for repair of the lesion and subsequent fork restart. By examining HR protein recruitment using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), we identified genomic loci that associated with multiple DNA replication and repair factors in response to the replication poison hydroxyurea (HU), and termed these regions early replicating fragile sites or ERFS. The Barlow lab uses a combination of molecular biology, microscopy and genome-wide sequencing techniques to investigate the molecular and genetic factors that predispose replicating cells DNA damage and genome instability using the mouse immune system as our model. Activated B lymphocytes can have a doubling time as short as 8 hours, suggesting that these rapidly proliferating cells are particularly vulnerable to replicative stress, and may contribute to lymphomagenesis.

This often requires using molecular components to achieve properties such as adaptation, sensitivity, and spatial processing of signals. As a favorite model system, we study how human neutrophils process dynamic extracellular chemical cues to guide their behavior. In order to chase a pathogen or migrate to a site of infection, a neutrophil must overcome challenges of breaking symmetry, generating stable cell polarity, and responding to spatial gradients of signaling molecules. The neutrophil response needs to be highly sensitive and decisive so that it can generate polarity, reorganize its cytoskeleton, and move, even if the input signal is weak or provides little spatial information. Additionally, in order to orient itself towards the highest concentration of the chemical attractant, the cell needs to compare input levels across space. We still know very little about how cells balance these goals or about the mechanisms that enable spatial processing. Finally, these cells are capable of responding to multiple attractant signals and prioritizing some over others. To tackle these questions, we use a combination of techniques with particular emphasis on systematic quantitative analysis of genetic perturbations, direct monitoring of signaling using live-cell imaging of fluorescent biosensors, optogenetic approaches to control protein activities with light, and mathematical modeling.

Viruses frequently infect the same host, leading to conflicts of interest over host resources. Viruses can evolve strategies to contend with co-infecting viruses, ranging from exploiting other viruses to synergistically interacting to increase their reproduction. Our research focuses on the evolution, ecology, and molecular mechanisms of these virus-virus interactions using genomics, experimental evolution, and environmental microbiology. The lab currently works on genetic exchange in two segmented RNA viruses: Cystovirus phages that infect Pseudomonas bacteria and influenza A viruses. The genome of these viruses is divided into segments. Viruses can swap their segments while reproducing within a cell, a process called reassortment. Reassortment is an important factor in determining the capacity to infect new hosts, evade immune responses or vaccines, and adapt to new environments.

In eukaryotes, several pathways compete for the repair of such lesions. Homologous recombination is the critical DSB repair pathway in yeasts and an important DSB repair pathway in all eukaryotes studied. We are using\u00a0 Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a lead system and employ genetical, molecular, and biochemical methods to elucidate the molecular mechanism of homologous recombination and recombinational DNA repair and its regulation by the DNA damage checkpoints. The key results are validated with human proteins and in human cells to establish lasting paradigms. Recombination has dual significance for cancer. Recombination genes are guardians of the genome and classic tumor suppressors. Hence, defects in recombination genes increase cancer risk. DNA repair and specifically recombination is also critical in anti-cancer therapy, as many modalities of treatment involve DNA damaging agents. We are applying our mechanistic insights from basic studies in more translational studies relating to cancer predisposition and anti-cancer therapy.

A key feature of the mammalian\u00a0germline is sexual dimorphism: the dual developmental processes of spermatogenesis and oogenesis. These processes are inherently complex,\u00a0which poses significant challenges to understanding the perpetuity of life and the development of treatments for germline-derived genetic and epigenetic diseases. Our research directions converge to address how epigenetic mechanisms govern spermatogenesis and oogenesis, culminating in the generation of functional sperm and eggs. Ultimately, we aim to clarify how fundamental germline mechanisms intersect to ensure genome maintenance, genome defense, and epigenetic gene regulation on a systemic level.

E. histolytica causes amoebiasis, a potentially lethal diarrheal disease in the developing world. The species was named \u201chistolytica\u201d ( histo-: tissue; lytic-: dissolving) for its ability to injure host tissue. E. histolytica trophozoites (\u201camoebae\u201d) possess potent cell-killing activity that is likely to drive tissue damage, but the mechanism by which amoebae kill cells was previously unclear. We discovered that amoebae kill human cells via an unusual mechanism, in which they bite off and ingest human cell fragments that contain human cell membrane, cytoplasm, and organelles. We named this \u201camoebic trogocytosis\u201d ( trogo-: nibble). Trogocytosis provides a new paradigm for the pathogenesis of amoebiasis. As an unusual cell killing insult, it further provides a vehicle to uncover new host cell death and survival signaling. Unlike phagocytosis ( phago-: devour), in which one cell \u201cswallows\u201d another, trogocytosis is poorly understood. However, there is an emerging appreciation that many eukaryotes take bites of membrane from other cells, sometimes together with intracellular contents, suggesting that this process is likely to be fundamental. Trogocytosis plays a role in signaling between immune cells, and intracellular bacteria stimulate host cell trogocytosis to promote their transfer from one cell to another. Other eukaryotic microbes use trogocytosis for cell killing, including the \u201cbrain-eating\u201d amoeba, Naegleria fowleri . Therefore, trogocytosis might represent a conserved strategy for eukaryotic intercellular exchange that is exaggerated and exploited for cell killing by microbial pathogens. Our work is therefore broadly relevant to conserved mechanisms for eukaryotic cell-cell interaction.

Flavivirus-host interactions Mosquito-borne flaviviruses such as dengue virus and Zika virus are a source of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. We study how these viruses hijack host machinery through virus-host protein interactions to better understand their replication and develop therapeutics. We have two active areas of research on flavivirus-host interactions: Antiviral Gene Expression Program Cells respond to viral infections by activating the expression of antiviral genes such as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), and viruses are continually evolving ways to evade this antiviral response. We study how flaviviruses including dengue and Zika virus hijack host gene expression machinery to inhibit the antiviral innate immune response. Zika virus associated microcephaly Viruses have long been known to cause birth defects when fetuses are infected in utero. For example, rubella virus, and cytomegalovirus cause a range of birth defects including microcephaly, in which brain and head size is severely reduced. Viral microcephaly has received renewed attention since Zika virus emerged on a global scale in 2015. We are integrating comparative proteomic approaches with high-throughput animal models to build an experimental pipeline. This will enable the rapid delineation of how Zika virus-host protein interactions lead to dysfunction of host proteins and inhibition of brain development. Capturing cellular responses with live-cell imaging Viruses perturb cells in a variety of ways. We build live-cell imaging systems to track how viruses and other environmental perturbations alter cellular behavior. We couple this with simple mechanistic models of cellular pathways or large-scale feature extraction to model and predict cellular responses. Biomolecular Engineering for Improved Viral Protein Production We produce viral proteins for research purposes, but some viral proteins are incredibly challenging to produce and are important inputs for various applications like vaccines and diagnostics. We use biomolecular engineering and biomanufacturing approaches to improve SARS-CoV-2 protein production. Synthetic Control of Gene Expression Just as viruses can control gene expression, we develop orthogonal methods to control gene expression using light and nutrients. These technologies have applications in tissue engineering and cultivated meat.

Meeks Breadcrumb Home Faculty John C. Meeks Position Title Professor Emeritus Microbiology and Molecular Genetics jcmeeks@ucdavis.edu Bio Research Interests Physiological, biochemical, genetic and genomic analysis of cellular differentiation in filamentous cyanobacteria - Symbiotic interactions. Our experimetnal system is the filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme. N. punctiforme is unique in that, depending on environmental signals, its vegetative cells can differentiate into three distinct and mutually exclusive cell types: nitrogen-fixing heterocysts (when limited for combined nitrogen), spore-like akinetes (when energy stressed), and motile by gliding hormogonium filaments (under conditions both positive and negative for growth). Moreover, N. punctiforme can fix nitrogen in free-living and plant-associated symbiotic growth states. The plant partners span the phylogenetic spectrum from Bryophyte hornworts and liverworts, to Gymnosperm cycads, and the Angiosperm family Gunneraceae. When in symbiotic association, the plant partners control the differentiation and physiological behavior of hormogonia (the infective units) and heterocysts (the functional units). The genome of N. punctiforme, at 9.059 Mbp, is large for a bacterium and is distributed between an 8.23 Mbp circular chromosome and five plasmids ranging from 26 to 354 kbp. We apply biochemical, genetic and genomic (proteomic and transcriptomic) approaches to identify and manipulate the regulatory pathways of free-living and symbiotic cellular differentiation of N. punctiforme.

Price Breadcrumb Home Faculty Chester W. Price Position Title Professor Emeritus Microbiology and Molecular Genetics cwprice@ucdavis.edu Bio Research Interests My work as a microbiologist focuses on the mechanisms regulating stress responses in bacteria. These are basic for survival in the natural environment, food systems, and pathogenic interactions. I aim to understand these responses beginning with the sensors that detect each stress, extending through the signal transduction pathways that convey this information to key transcription factors, and culminating with the role of the genes these factors control. Such response networks comprise modular components that are reshuffled for different signaling tasks. Uncovering their molecular underpinnings is therefore of wide biological interest, with practical relevance to agriculture, food safety, and infectious disease.

Roth Breadcrumb Home Faculty John R. Roth Position Title Distinguished Professor Emeritus Microbiology and Molecular Genetics jrroth@ucdavis.edu Lab website Bio Research Interests Origin of Mutations Under Selection While natural selection is simple to define, it is difficult to follow in natural settings since small-effect mutations often dictate the sequence of events. The high rate at which small-effect mutations arise seems to underlie a controversy that has continued about whether or not the stress of selective growth conditions induces an increase in mutation rate. We propose that growth limitation seems mutagenic because small-effect mutations are more common than generally appreciated and make an unexpectedly large contribution to selective adaptation. We are trying to dissect in detail one system that is often cited as evidence for stress-induced mutagenesis (adaptive mutation). We think we can convince you that it's all about growth under selection and has nothing to do with mutagenesis. \u00a0Surprisingly, this system involves mating between bacterial cells and localized over-replication of mutational target. A lifestyle that may define a bacterial species All Salmonellae dedicate 1% of their genome to synthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B12) and another 1% of their genome to use this cofactor for anaerobic growth on two non-fermentable carbon sources -- ethanolamine and propanediol. This constellation of functions must contribute heavily to Salmonella's fitness in a natural setting. Laboratory studies have had difficultly suggesting how these several functions might contribute to success of natural populations. Recently an solution has been suggested by our colleage Andreas Baumler at the UC Davis Medical School. Baumler's lab has shown that these functions contribute together to enhance Salmonella proliferation in an inflammed mouse gut. Salmonella induces gut inflammation and thereby causes the mouse to provide both of the two carbon sources and an repiratory electron acceptor. The inflammed host gut releases ethanolamine and propanediol and oxidizes hydrogen sulfide to tetrathionate which Salmonella can use as electron acceptor. This give Salmonella a source of nutrients that are not availbable to other gut inhabitants. The functions described above (B12 synthesis, ethanolamine and propanediol degradation, tetrathionate oxidation) have been used individually by taxonomists to identify Salmonella. Since essentially all Salmonella isolates show all of the properties, we suggest that these functions may be central to defining the lifestyle that characterizes Salmonellae and selective holds them together as a taxonomic group. Enzymes for catabolizing ethanolamine and propanediol are held within a protein cage or microcompartment that resembles the carboxysome of photosynthetic bacteria. We are trying to determine how this compartment works and how it benefits Salmonella in the wild. We think that understanding this compartment in Salmonella, may help us understand why similar compartments contain enzymes of CO2 fixation in bacteria that perform 30% of the global carbon fixation. Recombination as an Inside Job While DNA recombination is generally studied by perfoming genetic crosses in the laboratory, the process of recombination is used internally in bacteria, primarily for DNA repair and replication fork restarting. Sexual recombination is very rare in natural populations. We use chromosome rearrangments in Salmonella to learn about recombination mechanisms. Most recently we've found (to our surprise) that gene duplications arise at an extremely high rate and form by a mechanism that does not require recombination. This is despite the general belief that they form by unequal recombination. Many duplications are not simple tandem repeats but contain direct repeats that flank a central third copy positioned in inverse order (a tandem inversion duplication or TID). We're testing a model in which TIDs form by a series of events initiated by short palindromic sequences in the normal genome. These are then converted by remodeling deletions into the several types of duplications that are commonly studied. Domesticated transposable elements may dictate species-specific patterns of gene amplification The chromosomes of enteric bacteria harbor several sets of dispersed repeated sequences that are thought to be derived from ancient transposable elements. \u00a0These include REP, BoxC, RSA and ERIC elements. \u00a0Despite the inability of these elements to transposose, their sequences and positions appear to be maintained by purifying selection, suggesting that they play a valuable role in cell function. \u00a0Two properties are shared by all of these elements --- they are palindromic and are usually found within transcribed regions of the genome. \u00a0 Recently we've noticed recombination-independent duplications that form between copies of these palindromic elements, \u00a0We've also noticed that although these elements are found in many enteric species, particular forms appear to be species specific. \u00a0For example, the AelRep and LasRep elements consist of an RSA or Eric element with an inserted central palindromic element. \u00a0 The resulting composite elements are found in virtually all isolates of Salmonella but in no isolate of its closest relative, E. coli. \u00a0 Conversely, the BoxC related BOCE elements are found in E. coli, but ever in Salmonella. \u00a0 We suggest that palindromic elements dictate endpoints of duplications that are of frequent selective value in the lifestyles of various bacteria. \u00a0Their palindromic nature allows them to initiate TID duplications as described above. \u00a0Duplication formation can be regulated when transcription of the element generates an R-loop, in which the element appears in the excluded sense strand of DNA. \u00a0When made single-stranded, palindromes can form hairpins or more complex secondary structures that are subject to cutting and initiation of the duplicaiton formation. \u00a0 Similar functionality may be associated with ancient transpoable elements in metazoan genomes.
