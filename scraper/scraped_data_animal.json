Research is centered on interactions between sperm and oocyte plasma membrane molecules after sperm have undergone the acrosome reaction since our earlier work demonstrated that this was frequently the limiting step in vivo in subfertile animals. Details of these interactions including receptor/ligand pairings are still largely unknown. Environmental stresses such as elevated ambient temperature affect both the sperm\u2019s ability and the oocyte\u2019s ability to interact with each other at the plasma membrane level. We hypothesize that this is due to decreased/defective synthesis of interacting molecules. A second focus in our laboratory is the regulation of Sertoli cell proliferation. Sertoli cell numbers are a major determinant of postpuberal testis size and sperm production. The number of Sertoli cells is generally believed to be determined prepuberally. We have found that reducing endogenous estrogen in the boars postnatally leads to increased proliferation of Sertoli cells and larger postpuberal testes in the pig. This occurs without altered pituitary hormones in boars and strongly suggests a locally mediated mechanism. The pig is the primary species studied due in part to its importance to US and world food production as well as the availability of large numbers of gametes and comparatively short gestation and prepuberal intervals. In vitro oocyte maturation and fertilization, in vitro bioassays, gene expression (qPCR), immunohistochemistry, gel electrophoresis and western blotting, heterospermic insemination and other in vivo animal trials, CRISPR editing and embryo transfer are techniques used to advance our laboratory research goals.

However, the precise mechanisms regulating fetal oogenesis and development of early stage follicles (i.e., preantral follicles) in the ovary remain largely elusive in most mammalian species. The recent derivation of bovine embryonic stem cells (bESC) presents a unique opportunity to recreate bovine oogenesis and folliculogenesis in vitro, allowing the study of events that have otherwise been difficult to unravel. Our research focuses on ovarian biology and regulation of follicle development. We combine culture of bESCs, preantral follicles isolated or in situ within the ovarian cortex, and granulosa cells to encompass the different stages of oocyte and follicle development and help unravel local, systemic and environmental mechanisms that regulate fertility. As heat stress is recognized as one of the main causes of infertility in cattle, a second and equally important focus of the Denicol Lab has been the investigation of genetic selection of dairy cows for heat tolerance via introduction of the SLICK1 mutation. As reproductive health is a central component of overall health, the ultimate goal of our research is to improve reproductive success and assisted reproductive technologies to benefit animal agriculture, wildlife conservation, and human health.

To achieve this vision my research is focused into three distinct, yet overlapping applied research themes; (1) Aquaculture, (2) Invasion Biology and (3) Environmental/Ecological Toxicology. This research usually addresses data gaps and provides scientific solutions, determined through rigorous experimentation, meeting the immediate biological and engineering needs of the aquaculture industry and natural resource community. My research is historically a mix of laboratory and field experimentation. However, there are many times where the research is not exclusively one or the other, but instead, a blend where controlled laboratory experimentation is brought into the field. Other areas of interest include aquaponic production systems. More specific examples include: Conducting reproductive and developmental biology studies to improve fish and bivalve culture, humane harvest of fish, habitat utilization, and water quality. Future research will also focus on recirculating aquaculture and aquaponics systems for finfish and vegetable production. Developing technologies and strategies for the control of aquatic invasive and nuisance species, with the goal of conserving biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. Research explores traditional and novel physical, biological, and chemical approaches, addressing susceptible life history stages of target species and examining unintended effects on non-target species. Evaluating environmental stressors as factors that compromise ecological integrity and animal health. One of the areas I have significant interest in is the effects of anthropogenic sound on aquatic resources. Selected Publications Arthur N. Popper*; Jackson A. Gross*; Thomas J.

The long-term goal of our research is to enhance our understanding of microbe-microbe and microbe-host interaction to ensure the well-being of the host organisms. Our current main focus is the microbiome of ruminants. Research Area 2 - Climate Change/Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling: Microbial communities associated with agricultural systems are major sources of greenhouse gases such as N\u2082O and CO\u2082. The Hess Lab studies how microbial communities in these systems can be manipulated to reduce greenhouse gas emission. Currently we are developing strategies to mitigate greenhouse gas emission from ruminants, manure, and agricultural soils. Research Area 3 - Natural Products: Microorganisms are a potent source of fine and bulk chemicals. In the past, discovery and reconstruction of the genes and pathways involved in the synthesis of the final product was hindered by the recalcitrance of most microbes (~95-99% of all microbes) to isolation and cultivation. In our Lab we utilize a combination of different cultivation-independent approaches (e.g. single-cell technologies, phylogenomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics and metametabolomics) to overcome this recalcitrance to cultivation. Recently we have been screening microbial communities from diverse ecosystems for carbohydrate and hydrocarbon active enzymes and for microbial products that have antimicrobial activity.

Research Interests Retardation of lipid oxidation in poultry muscle, eggs and their products is the primary focus of my research. A series of antioxidants have been used, including polyphosphates and tocopherols, especially vitamine E. Presently, investigations center on the use of hydroxytyrosol, a by-product from olive oil processing, and \u03b1-tocopherol from tomato pomace, an agricultural by-product consisting of peels, cores, seeds, stems and green tomatoes from tomato processing. A secondary focus for research deals with the use of antioxidants to retard oxidation of cholesterol during processing of poultry and during the actual assay for cholesterol and its many oxidized derivatives. Thus, work continues to improve methodologies for determination of cholesterol and cholesterol oxidation products during analyses. In tangential research, tomato pomace is under investigation for it use in diets of laying hens. Additionally, research is underway to assess its usefulness in non feed removal molt diets for laying hens. Biography Annie J. King is a Professor in the Department of Animal Science at UC Davis. Her research, teaching and outreach concentrate on the nutritional quality of poultry meat, eggs and their products and use of agricultural by-products, containing antioxidants, in poultry feed. She served as the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Academic Programs in the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences for nearly 11 years (1994 -2005) and returned to Animal Science to continue her research program and as an instructor of avian and animal sciences courses in 2005. Presently, she serves as a faculty advisor for undergraduate students in the Department and as faculty advisor/instructor for the Contemporary Leadership Minor, part of the Science and Society Program and affiliated with the Center for Leadership Learning at UC Davis. Annie was a member of Class 30 of the California Agricultural Leadership Program and presently serves as the core faculty for the Program at Davis. As core faculty, she works with colleagues at three other California universities and the Director of Education at the California Agricultural Leadership Foundation to organize several leadership seminars per year for mid-career agriculturalists and others in closely related occupations. She received her B.S. degree in Foods and Nutrition from N.C. Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, North Carolina. Her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Food Science (minor in nutrition) are from NC State University, Raleigh, North Carolina. As a grandmother, she is the author of a series of children\u2019s books, the first of which (Granny Annie Lives at the Airport) was published in 2009.

Many of feed ingredients and additives now are available as potential \u2018alternatives to antibiotics\u2019, either by altering microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tract or by influencing the immune system. However, the still-unclear mechanism hampers their application in the industry. Our research interest is to evaluate dietary effects on pig health by investigating impacts of products now available to the industry and developing new approach for the industry. Our long-term goal is to help the animal industry deploy feed-based health technologies to improve animal health. A secondary research focus is to evaluate low-cost by-products or co-products from feed or food industry as feed ingredients for pigs. The efficient use of these low-cost ingredients in pig diets will increase the sustainability of swine production and reduce the reliance of energy on traditional ingredients, such as, corn and soybean meal.

Lysozyme is naturally found in human breast milk and has antibacterial properties that can help prevent diarrhea. More Position Title Associate Professor 530-752-5930 eamaga@ucdavis.edu Maga Lab Website 2125 Meyer Hall Bio Education B.S., \u00a0Chemical Engineering, Colorado State University, Ft. Collins, CO 1988. Ph.D., Food Science & Technology, UC Davis, Davis, CA 1994. Research Interests The overall goal of my research program is to demonstrate that milk from genetically engineered dairy animals containing increased levels of protective antimicrobial proteins can be used to improve human health. More specifically, we have generated transgenic goats that express increased levels of human lysozyme, a key human milk component thought to be involved with the development of a health-promoting gut microbiota. The overarching hypothesis is that upon consumption, lysozyme-rich milk will cause a beneficial modulation of intestinal microbiota populations thereby resulting in improved intestinal and overall health. The work conducted in my lab is both mechanistic and translational in nature by not only dissecting the role of gut microbiota on health, but also by translating the use of lysozyme-rich milk into an effective preventative or treatment agent against diarrheal illnesses. We use both animal models and cells in culture in conjunction with molecular techniques to 1) define the bacterial community structure of milk and the gastrointestinal tract, 2) investigate immune response at the level of the intestine upon milk consumption and 3) assess the safety of genetically engineered food animals and their products. In addition, studies on the relationship between casein genotypes and milk quality are being carried out in goats.

Past efforts have been focused on articular cartilage and tendon, particularly on how phenotypes for cells like chondrocytes, bone marrow stromal cells, and tendon peritenon- and tendon proper-derived progenitor cells differ by niche, or surrounding environment. Additionally, because collagen assembly and organization are important to functionally sound musculoskeletal tissue, my research interests include the examination of how collagen fibrillogenesis might be manipulated to achieve optimal recovery of tissues with repair. The ultimate goal is to determine if alterations in niche components and organization and/or interacting cell physiology can lead to alterations in repair pathways or tissue engineering strategies to prevent and treat musculoskeletal injury. In order to reach this goal, I rely on functional genomics as well as expressional (mRNA and protein) analyses, morphometric analyses, and biomechanical assays. I am interested in the physiology of usage and elite performance as well as pathophysiology from over-usage, acute and chronic injury for all musculoskeletal tissues on all species, as they might be related to use, environment, or genetics. Though past efforts have been primarily in horse and mouse, all animals are subject to musculoskeletal injury. Moreover, from performance species like dogs, horses, and us humans, to production species like cattle, swine, and poultry, painful musculoskeletal injuries and disorders are both costly and debilitating on so many levels.

(Hons)., Applied Biology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver Canada Research Interests: My research program uses a combination of applied ethology and epidemiology research methods and statistical techniques to study animal welfare. I have conducted research in a variety of areas including low-stress handling, agonistic interactions in socially housed animals, mitigating procedural pain and stress, and studying human-animal interactions. I conduct research with a range of animal species including companion, farmed, and laboratory animals. Broadly, I currently have three areas of study: 1) mitigating agonism in socially housed animals, 2) examining human-animal interactions during handling and other animal procedures , and 3) improving cat welfare in the veterinary clinic. Intraspecific agonistic interactions are a significant and complex issue occurring in a variety of socially housed captive animals such as commercially farmed animal species (e.g., pigs, laying hens, fish), domesticated pets (e.g., cats, dogs), and laboratory animals (e.g., mice, rats, rabbits). Although agonism is a normal part of an animal\u2019s behavioral repertoire, excessive agonism has detrimental consequences. These interactions can result in serious animal welfare issues associated with stress (e.g., subordination or dominance related), distress (i.e., prolonged inability to escape negative interactions), pain from wounding, and even death. Particularly I am interested in examining the influence of early experiences (social, environmental) on later intraspecific agonistic interactions. I have expertise in animal handling, having conducted low stress handling research in cats, mice, rats, and pigs. I have an interest in examining human-animal interactions during animal handling and other necessary procedures. Regardless of whether animal handling is occurring on farm, in a veterinary clinic, or a research laboratory, handling and restraint methods may impact the affective state of both the animal and the handler.\u00a0I am also interested in studying various approaches for improving human-animal interactions, and the impact these have on the human-animal relationship and animal welfare. Another area of interest is examining strategies for improving cat welfare in the veterinary clinic. Routine health and behavior care are essential for maintaining cat welfare. However, many factors may impede cat owner access to care including social factors such as area of household (example: rural and remote communities), age of owner (example: senior owners may face more challenges bringing their cat to the veterinary clinic), socioeconomic factors (example: access and cost of transportation, time away from home or work), and decreased owner willingness due to stressful experiences associated with clinic visits. Furthermore, with increasing concerns around public health and safety with the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become crucial to improve accessibility to high quality veterinary care. I am interested in studying various strategies for overcoming these barriers. I am currently accepting graduate students and undergraduate research volunteers. If you are interested in joining my lab please email me at cmoody@ucdavis.edu with your CV and research interests. My laboratory is committed to creating a\u00a0diverse and inclusive environment, and I encourage students from all backgrounds to apply.

Maintaining production of high-quality milk while addressing issues related to environmental sustainability and resource availability requires deeper understanding of the interactions between key dietary components like energy and protein, and the dynamics of digestion and metabolism in response to nutritional manipulation. The Nichols Lab focuses on characterizing the digestive and metabolic flexibility of dairy cattle to elevate our understanding of dietary protein and energy interactions, mammary gland metabolism, and postabsorptive nutrient utilization to improve the transfer of dietary nutrients into milk. We conduct studies investigating metabolite flux at the tissue level (e.g., mammary gland), energy and nitrogen balance, digestibility, and milk production in response to nutritional interventions. Further, we are interested in how the postabsorptive efficiencies of nutrients (e.g., amino acids) interact and change with the physiological state of the cow throughout lactation. Our lab has strong collaborations with global animal nutrition companies and other top-tier university research groups, with opportunities for interested students to gain international experience in the animal nutrition industry.

My research focuses mainly on aquatic organisms that are distributed along the California coast and estuaries (e.g. limpets, sea urchins, crabs, oysters and intertidal fishes), but extends to Antarctic fishes and aquaculture species.

To accomplish this,\u00a0my lab conducts animal feeding studies at both the whole animal and molecular level to identify/develop animal products enriched with bioactive nutrients, complemented by studies on their biochemical, physiological and gene expression effects in cell culture and animal disease models. In addition, we synergistically work with other University and Government researchers to follow-up on human health effects (i.e. clinical trials), carbon footprint (e.g. enteric methane emissions), as well as sensory and quality/manufacturing properties of nutritionally enhanced animal sourced foods.

This project is one of pilot projects of FAANG consortium ( www. FAANG.org ). The overall goal of this project is to generate a comprehensive resource of functional genomic elements for the chicken, cattle, and pig genomes. Our specific goals are: Annotate chromatin states corresponding to DNase hypersensitivity, four histone modifications, and one transcription factor Annotate promoters, enhancers, and silencers by integrating information from RNA-seq, DNAse-seq, and ChIP-seq against four histone modifications and one transcription factor. Freely distribute all raw and annotated data via UCSC Genome Browser and Ensembl. NIH-NIFA Dual Purpose with Dual Benefits project: Development of Colonization Resistance in Chicks . Our long-range goal is to understand the mechanisms that govern the interactions between the host and its gut-associated microbial communities. The objectives of this application are to study the mechanism of colonization resistance and devise strategies to prevent a bloom of Proteobacteria after hatching. Specific Aim 1: Determine the mechanism by which obligate anaerobic bacteria confer colonization resistance against Proteobacteria in newly hatched chicks Specific Aim 2: Determine whether a treatment that enhances colonization resistance accelerates development of a mature microbial community structure in newly hatched chicks.
