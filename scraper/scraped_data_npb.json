Research from our laboratory has identified the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1)/S6 protein kinase (S6K1) pathway as the central mechanism involved in physiological hypertrophy of skeletal muscle in response to resistance exercise. It is now clear that resistance exercise activates mTORC1 and that this activation is important in increasing muscle's capacity to boost protein synthesis. By studying the control of rDNA synthesis, we hope to identify molecules that are critical for this process and that can reproduce the increase in muscle mass without the need for the exercise stimulus Muscular endurance How is endurance exercise transduced into changes in mitochondrial mass and fatigue resistance? Unlike resistance exercise, endurance exercise results in a coordinated genetic response that increases aerobic capacity. Our laboratory and others have identified a central transcriptional cofactor that is activated following a single bout of aerobic exercise. The peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma coactivator (PGC)-1\u03b1 is a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and enzymes of fatty acid metabolism. It is now clear that many stimuli converge on PGC-1 and that a number of these molecules also inhibit the activation of the mTORC1/S6K1 pathway. Understanding this interplay will be essential if we are to develop genetic or pharmacological interventions to create bigger, stronger, and more fatigue resistant muscles. Ligament engineering Can we engineer ligaments to replace people's damaged ACLs? In our bodies, ligaments connect bone to bone, are essential to normal movement and do not repair very well. We have developed a series of calcium phosphate based cements that we are using to recreate the ligament to bone connection. Our engineered ligaments are developmentally similar to embryonic ligament. Using these constructs and our calcium phosphate cements, we have engineered the first in vitro ligament (bone-ligament-bone) with the hope of implanting these tissues into animals and in the future using them to repair ligaments in humans after rupture.

Her research group applies both qualitative and quantitative methods in their studies, and her research philosophy is informed by theory of learning, critical race frameworks, intersectionality and asset-based models. Originally from Argentina, Natalia pursued her Bs in Biology at the University of Buenos Aires and then came to the US where she pursued her PhD in Neuroscience at UC Berkeley focusing on the cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Following her postdoctoral work with Dr. Linda Wilbrecht studying the effects of early-life adversity on cognitive development and decision making in rodents, Dr. Caporale decided to dedicate herself to undergraduate education, which she adored, and she worked as a lecturer at UC Berkeley and SFSU for several years while also being a Visiting Scholar in Dr. Kimberly Tanner\u2019s lab, where she started her training in science education research. Identifying and Overcoming Barriers to Students' Success in Science I aim to identify barriers to the success of minorities and underrepresented students in science majors at UC Davis\u00a0and develop class interventions and departmental programs to help students overcome these barriers. In particular, I am deeply committed to the success of our transfer students, most of whom are ethnic minorities, first generation or non-traditional students. \u00a0For this, I hope to establish projects to involve local community colleges and CSUs. Improving Science Learning in Large Enrollment Courses It is a reality of our education system that courses are getting larger and larger and educators are faced with the need to modify our teaching to accommodate this new course format. Research in Physics, Chemistry and Biology over the last 30 years have identified various strategies that can increase student engagement, participation and learning in large science classrooms. Yet implementation remains a challenge. As a Faculty in UC Davis, I will be implementing many of these strategies in our classes while collecting evidence of their effectiveness as well as\u00a0researching the barriers at the student and faculty level that difficult the\u00a0transition\u00a0of our courses into to a more active learning,\u00a0student-centered teaching model. Conceptual Barriers to Changing People's Minds about Science One of the most challenging jobs science\u00a0educators have is to change student's minds about their intuitive ideas about how the physical world works. Such intuitive knowledge is a significant barrier to student's understanding of many fundamental concepts in the sciences. This research project focuses on identifying and documenting the\u00a0alternative conceptions that students bring into the biology classroom to develop better teaching strategies to help their learning of Biology.\u00a0In this context, and as a neuroscientist by training, I am very interested in science misconceptions and ways to develop better instructional tools to help students resolve them.

We are addressing the question how the brain processes sensory information and combines it with other information in order to select what action to take next and when to take that action. These mechanisms have mainly been studied from a psychological point of view, whereas neurophysiologists have largely concentrated on lower-level mechanisms. We are bridging this gap by utilizing both behavioral and neurophysiological methods and by using mathematical models for exploring potential neural mechanisms. The goal of our research is to provide a solid foundation for understanding human choice behavior, the neural implementation of decision mechanisms, as well as problems with decision-making in neurological and psychiatric disorders. In addition, our lab is also active in the area of neuroengineering, developing new technology that allows neuroscientists to address questions or test hypotheses that are difficult or impossible to investigate with currently available techniques.

Fischer Position Title Assistant Professor Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior ekfischer@ucdavis.edu Lab website Google Scholar 0000-0002-2916-0900 Bio Research Interests Biologists and non-biologists alike are fascinated by both widespread similarities and prodigious diversity in animal behavior. Nature documentaries, conservation agencies, and educators capitalize on the intuitive appeal of the fact that human and non-human animals exhibit similar behaviors \u2013 including aggression, courtship, and parental care \u2013 as well as the amazing diversity of forms these behaviors take and adaptations animals have to perform them. A modern extension of this fascination asks whether similarities in behavior are governed by the same underlying mechanisms. Exploration of underlying mechanisms can improve our understanding of the phenomena that shape evolution and dictate organisms\u2019 ability to adapt to novel and changing environments. Moreover, the accuracy of the assumption that shared phenotypes share underlying mechanisms is central to the success or failure of using non-human model organisms in biomedical research. In my lab, we use integrative approaches to address these questions across hierarchical levels of biological organization (from gene networks, to neural circuits, to physiology, to behavior) and timescales (from immediate, to developmental, to evolutionary). I believe that fundamental principles governing brains and behavior are most apparent in evolutionary and developmental contexts. We therefore leverage natural behavioral diversity with technological advances that allow cutting edge work outside of traditional model systems. Specifically, we capitalize on the morphological, physiological, and behavioral diversity (and charisma!) of frogs to understand mechanisms of behavior and its evolution. We also think frogs are great for community engagement and education. Just as we need human diversity in our teaching and research spaces, we need diversity in our study systems to address fundamental open questions and to distinguish shared core principles from species-specific diversity in the biological bases of behavior and its evolution.

One major project involves constructing models of networks involved in motor control and working memory in which a briefly presented stimulus leads to long-lasting, or \u201cpersistent\u201d, neural activity whose level encodes the triggering stimulus.\u00a0Our work focuses primarily on a model system for studying such activity, the oculomotor neural integrator, in which transient eye movement commands are accumulated into persistent neural signals that control the horizontal position of the eyes.\u00a0By modeling electrophysiological and optical imaging data, we seek to dissect the contributions of synaptic inhibition, synaptic excitation, and intrinsic cellular properties to the generation of the observed neural activity.\u00a0More recently, we have also been studying the role of the cerebellum in controlling the plasticity of oculomotor responses. In a second set of projects, we have been modeling how desert harvester ants make decisions about whether to leave their nest and forage for food in the arid desert climate.\u00a0 These ants appear to integrate sequences of contacts from successfully returning foragers who provide evidence related to the amount of food in the environment.\u00a0 We hypothesize that the behavior of the\u00a0ants can be described by a stochastic\u00a0leaky integrator\u00a0(that we term the\u00a0\"integrate-and-forage\" model) such that each contact increases the probability that the ant forages and, between contacts, there is an intrinsic decay of the accumulated decision variable.

Consequently our bodies have evolved sophisticated and subtle yet remarkably effective ways to maintain tight blood glucose control over the course of many decades. Key to glucose homeostasis are the opposing actions of insulin, which promotes peripheral uptake of glucose, and glucagon, which is a signal to the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose. These hormones are made by beta and alpha cells, respectively, which co-localize in the islets of Langerhans to facilitate the coordinated regulation of their release. The islets also contain somatostatin-producing delta cells, which provide essential negative feedback to both alpha and beta cells. My group studies how the alpha, beta and delta cells within the islet communicate with each other and integrate signals from the central and peripheral nervous system, gastro-intestinal tract, liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. We are only just starting to appreciate the depth and complexity of this intricate network, which contains potential therapeutic targets to treat or even cure diabetes. One of the family of signals that the Huising lab studies, is named for the stress peptide Corticotropin Releasing Factor, or CRF in short. CRF was originally discovered as the principal hypothalamic factor to initiate the stress response by acting on the pituitary gland. It turns out that the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas can respond directly to CRF with increased insulin secretion, increased beta cell proliferation and reduced beta cell death in the face of pro-inflammatory insults, which is a promising set of beneficial characteristics united in a single molecule. Urocortin3 (Ucn3), a peptide related to CRF, is abundantly expressed by mature beta cells. We discovered that Ucn3 is co-released with insulin to trigger somatostatin release from neighboring delta cells, which in turn inhibits insulin secretion. In essence, Ucn3 triggers a negative feedback loop that attenuates insulin secretion, provided that glucose levels are successfully reduced. Ucn3 expression also distinguishes mature, functional beta cells from their immature progenitors, which is a trait that is particularly useful to track the differentiation of mature, glucose-responsive beta cells from embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells. CRF and Ucn3 are just two examples of signaling molecules whose direct actions on the pancreas add a novel layer of complexity to the intricate network of signaling molecules that in concert governs beta cell mass and insulin and glucagon output of the pancreas. My group is focused on unraveling the contributions of these local pancreatic CRF family signaling cascades on glucose metabolism in healthy and diabetic individuals.

One of the current projects focuses on a resulting human diabetes susceptibility gene- C2CD4A. We have generated several animal models, cell lines, and necessary reagents to investigate a link between pancreatic beta-cell, exercise-induced hypoglycemia, and type 2 diabetes therapy. These studies will advance our understanding of C2CD4A, and provide a blueprint to leverage human genetics data into biological insight that will eventually benefit patients.

Miller Breadcrumb Home Faculty Lee M. Miller Position Title Professor Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior Otolaryngology 530-297-4474 leemiller@ucdavis.edu Lab website Bio Research Interests My research focuses on understanding the neural bases of auditory perception and speech recognition in human listeners. Countless normal listeners have trouble understanding speech in noisy environments, and certain special populations, such as those with learning impairments, autism, or using hearing aids and cochlear implants, face even greater difficulties. Among these, the most numerous are individuals with hearing loss, now numbering 30 million Americans and half a billion worldwide. This reduced ability to communicate often leads to depression, loneliness, and social anxiety, particularly in older adults. Untreated hearing loss in the U.S. costs tens of billions of dollars annually, with immeasurable human costs. Using non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), high-density electroencephalography (EEG), and neural network analysis, my research aims to learn how different parts of the brain cooperate to achieve perception, especially in noisy environments, and what happens when comprehension fails. Results from this research may lead to practical solutions such as improved audiological diagnosis and targeting, enhanced hearing-device design, better speech recovery after device fitting, improved training on listening strategies, and greater social integration among special populations. This research is generously supported by the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

My specialty is olfaction - the sense of smell - and much of my research has focused on exploring how marine birds and fishes use smell in the natural environment. I have worked in areas ranging from olfactory homing in salmon, to olfactory foraging, navigation and individual recognition in birds, and in particular, petrels and albatrosses. Because our world is experiencing rapid, anthropogenic change, our work increasingly interfaces with problems associated with global climate, habitat loss or degradation and by-catch concerns in marine fisheries. Many of the species we study are currently threatened or endangered. In line with this concern, we also conduct research on the proximate and evolutionary factors contributing to phenotypic plasticity, and this work has been carried out primarily with model fish species (various species of desert pupfish and salmon).

To achieve these goals, my research program investigates neural mechanisms and biomechanical consequences of CNS pathologies causing motor dysfunction; development of biomarkers of motor recovery; and novel means to induce neuroplasticity and recovery. This translational neuroscience research combines expertise in neurophysiological (i.e., transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), EEG, EMG, motor unit recordings, reflex probes), neuroimaging, biomechanical (measures of force production, kinetics), behavioral (kinematics), and clinical approaches to study human performance, and as a result, crosses disciplines of motor control, neuroscience, biomechanics, clinical medicine, rehabilitation, and bioengineering. My research supports clinical care in neurorehabilitation or individuals with motor dysfunction resulting from neuropathologies, such as stroke, to aid in recovery, restore activity participation and optimize quality of life.

Age-related hearing deficits affect the majority of American retirees, and virtually all Americans over the age of 75. These deficits go beyond a simple loss of hearing, but also result in a poor ability to tell where different sounds are coming from, and in understanding speech. Our research investigates how natural aging affects the cerebral cortex, the neural structure that is necessary for one to perceive, and appreciate, different sound qualities. Our ultimate objective is to better understand cortical processing mechanisms in young and aged brains in order to develop effective remedial therapies to circumvent age-related hearing loss.

We employ a multidisciplinary approach that includes recording the electrical activity of single neurons, behavioral studies, psychology, and quantitative methods. Our research addresses how we distinguish sounds, such as an alarm clock from a barking dog, or an ambulance siren from a car horn, and how we can understand speech in noisy environments like crowded parties. We focus on the role of higher auditory areas in the midbrain, thalamus, and cortex in sound perception and sound-guided behavior. Our recent findings show that these areas, thought to be purely auditory, are also influenced by attention and decision-making, suggesting they play a role in guiding behavior as well as sensing sounds.

The long-term goal of the Usrey laboratory is to understand the functional properties of neural circuits that serve vision and the relationship between cell physiology, circuit activity, behavior and perception. Current research projects are focused on determining (1) how sensory information is processed and transmitted within and between brain areas, (2) the cellular and circuit mechanisms that mediate the effects of spatial attention on visual processing, (3) the role of feedback pathways for vision, and (4) the relationship between neural activity and visual perception. Using an arsenal of techniques, we are discovering how sensory information is established and encoded in brain activity, as well as the mechanisms employed by the brain for communicating information dynamically from one level to the next.

Most of the excitatory synaptic connections in the cortex occur on dendritic spines, tiny protrusions that extend from the dendritic membrane. Dendritic spines are highly dynamic during development both in vitro and in vivo; periods of high motility coincide with synapse formation. Spine motility, driven by actin dynamics, is thought to allow the postsynaptic neuron to explore and sample presynaptic partners. In addition, alterations of spine dynamics and stability have been observed during learning, leading to the hypothesis that these anatomical changes underlie the adaptive remodeling of cortical circuits. The identification and characterization of the molecules and mechanisms that control spine morphogenesis will be a crucial step toward understanding the formation and plasticity of cortical circuits. Our approach to this problem combines time-lapse imaging to observe nascent spine formation, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to measure protein dynamics, with molecular manipulations of synaptic proteins to decipher their roles in the growth of dendritic spines and synapses. In addition, we use electrophysiological measurements in combination with two-photon uncaging of glutamate to examine the function of nascent synapses at the single synapse level.

As migration is the movement to and away from areas where species breed, each trip is composed of multiple steps or substages that involve regulation of the neuroendocrine, endocrine, metabolic, and behavioral systems. During these trips, organisms are exposed to a wide range environmental conditions that include photoperiod, atmospheric and climatic, food availability, predation and unpredictable pertubations. Thus, in order for migrants to be successful they rely on environmental information to cue progression of each substage. Migrants therefore can serve as an effective model for studying how organisms rely on environmental conditions and respond to environmental changes and in particular global climate fluctuations. Former studies have focused on the effects of photoperiod, lunar condition, food availability and stressors on migratory specific characteristics that include migratory behavior (migratory restlessness, feeding, locomotor activity) and measures of the endocrine and metabolic systems. My other studies include vocal communication of nocturnal migrants, role of experience and geomagnetic field on orientation during migration, endogenous rhythms and migratory behavior, effects of prolonged migratory restlessness on the endocrine and metabolic systems. Most recently my laboratory has used the migrant/resident model present in the Pacific White-crowned Sparrows subspecies (Zonotrichia leucophrys) to compare the physiological and behavioral traits attributed to the migratory life history and assess whether these features are present in residents and may be considered more in seasonal terms rather then strictly migratory.
